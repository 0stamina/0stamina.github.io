<h1>Description</h1>
<p>A small survivors-like about a space girl fighting aliens on the moon.</p>
</br>
<p>Kill enemies to absorb their energy, and use that energy to craft yourself a new gun when ammo gets low. The more energy used when you craft the more points you gain.</p>
<p>If your ammo gets too low you start using your health as ammo so be careful.</p>
</br>
<li>Rifle — basic auto fire</li>
<li>G. Launcher — shoots out bombs</li>
<li>Flamethrower — burns enemies</li>
<li>Shotgun — shoots out multiple projectiles</li>
</br></br>

<h1>Post-Mortem</h1>
<p>This is mostly a game to can do what it takes to make a game and publish it. Despite imperfections, and time limits I did what I needed to and I hated it.</p>
<p>Quality control is almost non-existent, intentionally so. I made this game in 4 months, half of which was spent on a design and art style that I ended up not even using.</p>
<p>Despite challeneges and short comings, I made a game that is playable on steam which is good enough for now.</p>
