    <p>11/24/2024</p>
    <p>Yesterday was the first day of Thanksgiving break and I wanted to start document the development of my next project. At the moment it's pretty bare bones, it's built using Raylib as a graphics library and everything else is custom code. The UI and physics are fully functional, but everything else is placeholder.</p>
    <p><img src="small demo.gif" alt="" height="200/" /></p>
    <p>To fix this, for the next week I want to add at least 3 more new things. Big or small, mechanical or visual. The only caveat is that back-end doesn't count. This all starts today with the implimentation of the new unit, the fisherman.</p>
    <p><img src="fishing.gif" alt="" height="200//" /></p>
    <p>The fisherman's special ability is, upon making contact with an enemy, they get tied together with a rope. When they get too far the fisherman drags the enemy along. The enemy still has collission while being dragged which can lead to a few funky interactions. Not alot technical going on there, but I'll need to do some testing to make sure the physics don't freak out. The rope uses inverse-kinematics, specifically a modifed FABRIK algorithm.&nbsp;It was a pretty simple solution but gives a nice result for the physics and visuals.</p>
    <p>Depending on what I decide to add, the next 2 additions will be shown on the next devlog at the same time. But until then I'll be enjoying myself.</p>
